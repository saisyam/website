      <description>Including Github Gists into a webpage is a common practice. But sometimes I would like to add a source file from one of my repos (public repos) into the webpage instead of splitting the file into multiple gists.
I write technical blogs which involve lots of code to be shown and explained as you are reading now. I want to embed any source file from my public Github repo into my webpage or my blog.</description>
